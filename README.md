## 💡 Inspiration

This project was inspired by my daughter, **Sifra**, who recently finished her exams and made the courageous decision to dedicate a year to the **Royal Mission School**. To help raise funds for her journey, I wanted to build a platform that reflects her faith, values, and mission — and open it to others needing support too.
