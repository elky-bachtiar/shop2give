Color Enhancement Prompts
1. Progress Bar Variations
Add subtle color variations to progress bars based on campaign categories:
- Medical campaigns: Use warmer teal (#4ECDC4 with slight orange undertone)
- Education campaigns: Use cooler teal (#4ECDC4 with slight blue undertone) 
- Mission/Faith campaigns: Keep current teal (#4ECDC4)
- Community campaigns: Use slightly deeper teal (#3CBCB5)

Update the progress bar component to accept a 'category' prop and apply the appropriate color variation. Make sure the changes are subtle enough to maintain brand consistency while creating emotional connection to cause types.
2. Success States with Gold Accent
Add a complementary gold/yellow accent color (#F7DC6F or #F4D03F) for success states:
- "Fully Funded" campaign badges
- Achievement milestones (25%, 50%, 75%, 100% funded)
- Success messages after donations
- "Thank you" confirmations
- Campaign completion celebrations

Create a new CSS class for gold accents and update relevant components to show these success indicators. The gold should feel warm and celebratory while complementing the existing teal palette.
3. Call-to-Action Button Hierarchy
Create a secondary button style for less critical actions:
- Primary buttons: Keep current teal (#4ECDC4) for "Add to Cart", "Donate Now", "Start a Shop2Give"
- Secondary buttons: Use a lighter teal outline style (#4ECDC4 border with white/transparent background) for "View All Campaigns", "View All Products", "Learn More"
- Tertiary buttons: Use subtle gray (#E8E8E8) for "Cancel", "Back", navigation actions

Update the button component to accept variant props (primary, secondary, tertiary) and apply appropriate styling.

4. Add Categories to Main Navigation
Add a "Categories" dropdown menu to the main navigation between "Campaigns" and "Products":
- Categories should include: Medical, Education, Mission & Faith, Community, Emergency Relief
- Create a dropdown component that appears on hover/click
- Each category should link to a filtered view of campaigns
- Add category filtering functionality to the campaigns page
- Ensure mobile responsiveness for the dropdown menu
- Style the dropdown to match the existing teal theme
5. Fix Campaign and Product Clicking on Main Page
Fix the click functionality for campaign cards and product cards on the homepage:
- Campaign cards should navigate to individual campaign detail pages (e.g., /campaign/[id])
- Product cards should navigate to individual product detail pages (e.g., /product/[id])
- Ensure the entire card area is clickable, not just text/images
- Add hover effects to indicate clickability (subtle shadow or scale transform)
- Create the missing detail page templates if they don't exist
- Ensure proper routing and parameter passing for dynamic pages
6. Fix Add to Shopping Cart in Featured Products
Fix the "Add to cart" functionality in the Featured Products section:
- Ensure cart functionality is properly connected to a cart state management system
- Add product details (name, price, image, description) to cart when clicked
- Show visual feedback when item is added (success message, cart icon animation, button state change)
- Implement cart persistence (using React state or context, NOT localStorage due to Claude restrictions)
- Add cart counter in the header navigation
- Create a cart sidebar or page to view added items
- Ensure proper error handling if add to cart fails
