## ✝️ Why This Project Matters

My daughter Sifra chose to follow God and attend Royal Mission School. Inspired by her, I built Shop2Give as a way to support her—and others—through faith-based fundraising that combines purpose and generosity.

> 💡 *What started as one campaign became a platform to empower many.*
